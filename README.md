# LibrarySystem


I have made this project as a sort of Java practice. I was originally planning to make a GUI for this app, however I decided to leave for my next project, just to not overcomplicate things.

##Features

- You can add and remove books and clients with ease
- Show and search your desired books and client by different categories
- Save and load your current library status to a separate file
    
## Tech used

- Java


## Additional information

 - This project is fully open source, so please, do feel free to use this code freely and make your own changes and/or improvements
 - Keep in mind, that this is my first ever Java project, so the code itself might not seem to be the most professional, but I did sorta manage to keep the code readable
